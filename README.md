## Subtitle: 
Explore The World Of Quantum Programming On Quantum Hardware and Simulators

## Target Audience 
The audience consists of developers, data scientists, and researchers who are proficient in Python and are interested in quantum computing. Readers may have a background in general software engineering, security, finance, science or data science/analytics and want to learn about the state- of-the-art of quantum programming to understand if and how near-term or future applications of the technology can become a relevant resource to their field.
## Short Description
The goal of this book is to give the reader the knowledge and tools required to start writing their own quantum programs in python.
## Long Description
The need to make quantum computing concrete is especially pressing (and exciting!) as companies such as IBM, Google, Intel, and Rigetti present the public with larger and larger quantum devices. The capabilities and scope of such devices are not well known by the public at large, and are not universally agreed upon even within the field.The book will start with an introduction to quantum computing and a comprehensive overview of the quantum programming languages currently available, such as QCL, QASM, QUIL, and the differences between them. It will then, guided by examples, teach the reader how to write popular quantum algorithms in some of these languages, such as Grover’s search and Shor’s factorization algorithm.  
 
Lastly, the book will explore how machine learning can be used as part of quantum algorithms, for example in QAOA, and in turn, how quantum algorithms can be used to speed up machine learning, in the field of quantum machine learning.

## Key Features

1. The basics of quantum computing and quantum hardware
